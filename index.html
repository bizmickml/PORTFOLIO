    <article id="main-content">

      <h2 class="subheading">They Told Me I Should Be An Engineer...but I didn’t listen.</h2>
      <article id="now-section" class="text-content">
        <p>Do you remember back in the day when they used to give kids in grade school those test? You know, the ones that told you what you should be when you grow up.</p>
        <p>...what did they call them?</p>
        <p>Oh yeah, aptitude tests!  ...or something like that.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I remember taking those several times throughout my gradeschool days and my results always said I should be an engineer or an architect, but all those results said to me was, “MORE SCHOOL” and boy did I <strong>hate</strong> the sound of that!</p>
        <p>That’s because for me, school was a joke.  I hated every minute of it. I wasn't because I hated learning, although I didn’t know that back then. I hated school because most of the time, I felt like I could have taught the class I was in, which made things very boring for me.  So I didn’t really care too much about being engaged during class, not academically anyway.</p>
        <p>I never had to study in school or even try hard.  I just understand the concepts. I didn't study to ace the tests.  Oh, and homework... yeah, what’s that?</p>
        <p>Of course, today I can admit that I have a tremendous <em><strong>gift</strong></em> that most people don’t have.</p>
        <p>You see, I have this <em>powerful</em> ability to just learn things quickly and efficiently, but I wasn't aware of this gift then, so it mostly just got me into trouble...</p>
        <div>  
          <hr />
          <p class="block-quote">The real problem was that I actually <span class="underline">LOVE</span> learning, but school wasn’t the right environment for someone who can’t get enough learning, you had to stop where the teacher stopped and go when the rest of the class was ready.</p>
          <hr />
        </div>
        <p>Can you imagine the torture that was for someone like me?  So,  in order to cope with that, I suppose, I became more of a class clown than anything else.  Oh, and a musician, of course!  That was something I excelled at more than anything, and I loved it!  But, more on that later.  </p>
        <p>Since the idea of school made me nautious, when those aptitude tests told me I should be an engineer, I rejected idea, of course.  Honestly, the thought of <strong>more school than was required,</strong> sounded like <em>prison</em> to me!  The only thought I had was, “how can I get out of here the quickest way possible?”  I never intended to seek out higher education, not formally anway.  </p>
        <p><strong>So, why did those aptitude tests tell me I should be an engineer?</strong>  Didn’t they know I hated school?  I’ll admit, at one point, I held the belief that it was some grand conspiracy to get every kid into college, and perhaps I still think that, to some degree.  But I’d like to think I’ve matured a little since then, maybe even enough to discover the real reason for those test results all those years ago.</p>
        <div class="key-point">
          <p>See, it’s like this -</p>
          <p><span class="underline">My engineering mind</span> wants to pick apart every little detail and decipher all the whys and rearrange them into something more efficient, or apply that knowledge to build a better, quicker, more efficient process in some other area.</p>
          <p><span class="underline">My creative mind</span> wants to spend the day dreaming up some new concept or idea whether it be music, business, marketing or technology, you name it, my creative mind is coming up with some new concept, idea, or solution.</p>  
        </div>
        <hr />
        <p class="block-quote">It’s just the way my brain works . . . the way I was created!</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Of course, when I was in grade school, I wasn’t astutely aware of how my mind worked, so it mostly just got me into trouble.</p>
        <p>Thank God, in my last year of high school, one of my math teachers recruited me as a salesperson into a multi-level marketing company which exposed me to the amazing concept of business and entreprenuership.  This was just the environment I needed to spark a fire in me.  Never before had I been so motivated to grow and to learn.  It was like, <em>“I found it, an environment where you can learn and grow at your own pace, without having to wait for everyone else to catch up!”</em></p>
        <p>I read soooo many books and devoured  so many teachings during that season of my life.  I think I learned more during that time than I had learned throughout all of highschool.  </p>
        <p><strong>Business lit up my entreprenurial mind like nothing else had!</strong>  But it wasn’t long before I discovered that the business I had been recruited into, wasn’t actually very interesting to me, so my involvment there didn’t last.  But I did take my newfound passion for business and self-improvement with me.  And my first year out of high school, I started my own business as a carpenter.</p>
        <p>Carpentry was a trade I had picked up working alongside my dad who was a builder while I was growing up.  I’m not sure why I chose carpentry as my place to start in business.  Maybe it was the creative side of me wanting the reward of making things with my hands.  Maybe it was the fact that my dad had some connections with some clients that would help me jumpstart my business.  Whatever it was, I was acutely focused on the idea of starting, growing, and building a business.  I wanted to be successful enough to be a positive influence in many people’s lives while making a ton of money. </p>

      <h2 class="subheading">What 20 Years In Carpentry Taught Me</h2>
      <article id="backstory" class="text-content">
        <p>Even before that period of time when I was in school and hating every minute of it, my dad brought me to work with him one day and showed me how to smash out walls with a sledgehammer and a prybar. <em>What kind of boy doesn’t love smashing things?</em> I took my first swing and immediately knew it was going to be something I enjoyed.</p>
        <p>Me and another teenage family member spent the rest of the day smashing and shoveling, telling jokes, and smashing and shoveling some more. I didn’t know it then, but what began that summer was a love for construction. </p>
        <p>I spent several years of my life learning music and trying to figure out what I wanted to do when I grew up. I tried college, sales, culinary arts and eventually ended up back in construction for a time. I started a business and learned framing and carpentry and managing people. Somewhere along that process I got married and had kids (<em>we have 5</em>)! Now that I had a family to look after I had to consider the money I was making, and it wasn’t long before I took a management job. Sadly, the market condition of the industry at the time caused me to seek out an alternative to what I had been doing and it seemed like I could make more money being a project manager.</p>
        <p>Taking on the role of a project manager was one of the easiest jobs I have ever had, and I did make more money, but there was something missing. I didn’t even realize it until we volunteered to help with a vacation bible school that our church was putting on. My job was to cut out big animal shapes from sheets of plywood that would later become backdrops for selfies.</p>
        <p>I still remember it like it was yesterday…. I was cutting the wood and there was a moment where I took a whiff and realized, “I actually miss the smell of freshly cut wood.” I told my wife who said, “why don’t you go back into business for yourself?”</p>
        <p>Well, the rest is history. We birthed BizMick Construction in 2011 and never looked back. I guess I had to try all that other stuff before I could really discover that I loved to build things…more specifically I loved woodworking. I discovered I had an eye for quality and for fine detail. I took pride in my work like I never had before. It wasn’t long before the industry began to lead me to some very high-end clients which demanded the most stringent of tolerances.</p>
        <div>
          <hr />
          <p class="block-quote">See, carpentry like most industries, has a tolerance. How much can we be off in either direction before it becomes too much?</p>
          <hr />
        </div>
        <p>Now, I can boast that I’ve worked on projects ranging from small repairs to twenty-million-dollar, high-end, residential construction jobs; the kind of jobs you see featured in magazines. How have I had these amazing opportunities? The answer – tolerance. You see, as a finish carpenter, I’ve learned to only allow a tolerance of 1/32 of an inch. This makes the product I deliver not only good, not only better, but the best. Most people can’t even see 1/32” without a magnifying glass and a special measuring tool so to the naked eye my completed work seems to be without flaw. Now we all know that perfection isn’t possible, but we can certainly come ever so close.</p>
        <p>To the BizMick family, 1/32” has become sort of a motto. Not only does tolerance apply to what we do but also how we do it. How do we carry ourselves? How do we interact with others? The concept of 1/32” affected my carpentry so much, it wasn’t long before the concept began to spill over into other areas. I began to ask myself, “what would my life look like if I applied the principle of 1/32” to everything?” Here it is: If 1/32 of an inch is barely visible then the amount we allow ourselves to be “off” or “out-of-line” must be scarcely perceived. The answer to the question looks like this; we treat people with dignity and respect. We are honest about schedules, successes, and mistakes. Our recommendations are based on what is best for the customer not the bottom line. We are transparent, trustworthy and truthful which makes us easy to work with. Our motto of 1/32” tolerance means the customer gets a superior job, a better experience and therefore, highly recommends us which benefits us. 1/32” means everyone wins!</p>

      <h2 class="subheading">A Sudden Need For Change</h2>
      <article id="change-section" class="text-content">
        <p>Have you ever had the experience of suddenly becoming unable to perform a task you’re used to doing on a regular basis?</p>
        <p>I have.</p>
        <p>Some time ago I was working on a jobsite and was tring to lift my nailgun off the ground, something I do all day long many times throughout the day, only this time, I wasn’t able to pick it up.  There I was lifting with all my might and, nothing.  No matter how hard I pulled on that handle I could not lift that nail gun from the ground.  (If you’re a marvel fan, just imagine me trying to lift Thor’s hammer for a second...)</p>
        <p>I wish that I could say someone was pulling a prank on me, but what I didn’t know at the time was that I was experiencing my first MS flare.  During that time, MS caused ½ of my body to go numb and caused me to lose <strong>A LOT</strong> of strength over a very short period of time.</p>
        <p>I felt helpless...</p>
        <p>I mean, as a carpenter I lift things all day long to do what I do.  Those beautiful masterpiece archways don't just throw themselves up there you know.</p>
        <p>I won’t go into great detail about the physical struggle this condition has brought into my life, but I think it goes without saying that I had to start rethinking some things...</p>
        <p>It’s been about 10 years since that first episode.  I’ve had times of feeling great, and other times where I couldn’t physically perform my work.  Trying to continue in doing the work that I’ve always done has been a struggle to say the least.  So, after 10 years of fighting against my physical condition, I finally decided I was going to make a change...</p>
        <p>But, what could I do? - While recovering from an MS flare, I spent a lot of time "soul-searching" to come up with the answer to that question.  I love carpentry, but I have to be able to support my family even if I’m experiencing an MS flare.  So I asked myself, “What can I still do even during periods of time that my physical strength is affected by this condition?”</p>

      <h3 class="subheading">. . . What Now?</h3>
      <article class="text-content">
        <p>I decided that what I really need is an opportunity to be able to work remotely <em>while</em> making a good living to support my family.  I didn't have to look long before coming across the Full Stack Developer path.  It seemed like it could provide both the remote atmosphere and the income I was looking for while being a challenge at the same time. Not to mention the perfect fit for both my engineering mind and my creative brain!</p>
        <p>So what's next?</p>
        <p>I've been learning since January of 2025 and loving every minute of it.  I found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> to learn from for <em>free</em>!  I've also sat in on many courses and spend plenty of time reading the docs as well as practicing my new craft.</p>
        <p>I've been able to tackle <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> without a problem.</p>
        <p>I'm also familiar with <strong>Bootstrap, SASS, JQuery and React</strong>.</p>
        <p>I am superbly confident that I can learn whatever is needed for any project and I'm ready to take it on!</p>
        <p>Please check out my project links in the projects section.  I'm actively seeking opportunities that will allow me to work remotely while being challenged to grow and learn.</p>
