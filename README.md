# Michael Lamondy - Web Developer
Hi, I'm Michael Lamondy.  I've been coding since Jan 2025, changing careers after mastering Carpentry over a period of more than 20 years. 

[My portfolio page](https://bizmickml.github.io/PORTFOLIO/) describes my journey, my motivations and showcases my coding skills in 
- HTML, 
- CSS, 
- and JavaScript.  

I am also currently getting familiar with **JQuery, SASS, Bootstrap and React**.  
My aim is to master full stack web development. I am actively seeking remote work where I can apply the skills I have aquired so far and be challenged to grow.   

Feel free to reach out to me any time with suggestions or opportunities.  I keep my options open!
